ZED V2.0a
=====

This is the currently most stable version of ZED.
It has been completely rewritten and supports an external API.
To configure the scoreboard colors, go to the config.lua in the shared folder.   
You can also open the chat entry box with "/" as well as with t, and it will enter "/" for you in the chat when you use "/", so commands are easier now.   

Documentation can be found in the Wiki.


Here are my official supported plugins for ZED:
[Groups](https://github.com/evildev/Groups) | [Essentials](https://github.com/evildev/Essentials)

Also fully supported is a Teams plugin which I'm currently selling.
It features all the features from the official factions plugin + even more.

How to install ZED:
--------

What is ZEDTunnel ?
--------------------------------
ZEDTunnel is a module addition you can drag'n'drop to every external module (eg. derby, freeroam etc.) and make it magically use ZED's Chat System.

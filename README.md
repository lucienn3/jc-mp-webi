How to install?:

* Download the Version as .zip
* Drag'n'drop all the htdocs from the .zip into the www folder of your server.


This is directly useable. 
Please change the password in the config.inc.php and change the lang if needed.
If you have a existing server just drag and drop it in the server folder. The system should detect the server and show it in the webinterface.
